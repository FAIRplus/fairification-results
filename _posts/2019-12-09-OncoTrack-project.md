# OncoTrack


## Summary
The goal of OncoTrack is to identify and characterize biological markers that will help our understanding of the variable make-up of tumours and how this affects the way patients respond to treatment. We shall use cutting edge laboratory-based genome sequencing techniques coupled to novel computer modelling approaches to study both the biological heterogeneity of colon cancers (i.e. patient to patient variability) as well as  tumour variation within the patient – for example, by comparing primary tumours with metastases.

We believe that the results of this research will allow the identification and qualification of a set of biomarkers that may be used to guide patient therapy, provide immediate feedback upon the effects of treatment and ultimately indicate likely outcome of disease management – i.e. Oncology Tracking!
