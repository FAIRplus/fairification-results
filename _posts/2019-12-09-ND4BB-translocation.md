# IMI ND4BB TRANSLOCATION


## Summary
As part of the IMI antimicrobial resistance (AMR) programme New Drugs for Bad Bugs, TRANSLOCATION aims to increase the overall understanding of how to get antibiotics into multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and how to stop the bacteria from ejecting the drug. In sharing the knowledge and data discovered, TRANSLOCATION will develop guidelines for designing and developing new drugs to tackle antibiotic resistance and create an information centre for pre-existing and on-going antibacterial research data which will be used to establish best practices for future antibacterial drug discovery efforts.
