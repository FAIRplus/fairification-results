# eTOX

## Summary
In vivo toxicological studies carried out by means of non-GLP and GLP animal experiments represent a key step in drug development, since they often unveil straight chemistry-linked toxicities or mechanisms such as cross-target activations or inhibitions related to side effects of drugs. Early in silico prediction of in vivo toxicological outcomes would increase the quality of drug candidates and ensure a lower attrition rate during subsequent phases of the drug development pipeline. This would also reduce the number of animals (3Rs) to be used in preclinical studies.

The in silico prediction of biological phenomena on the basis of structural information of the drug candidates shows attractive results in the case of some molecular pharmacology parameters (e.g., affinities for particular biological targets), in some pharmacokinetics-related properties, or for a few toxicological endpoints such as mutagenicity. Nevertheless, the in silico prediction of most of the important in vivo outcomes on the basis of information available in early stages of the drug development is still far from being a reality.
